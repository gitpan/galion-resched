<h1><a name="app__galionresched">App::GalionReSched</a></h1>
<p>Galion ReSched is a web-based resource-scheduling application,
written in Perl.  It can be used to book limited resources
(such as computers and meeting rooms), so that you always know
who is scheduled to use any given one at any given time.</p>
<p>In addition, Galion ReSched now also features special program
signup lists and staff schedule tracking.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="live_demo">Live Demo</a></h2>
<p>There's a live demonstration so you can see Galion ReSched in action at
<a href="http://cgi.galion.lib.oh.us/staff/resched-public/resched/">http://cgi.galion.lib.oh.us/staff/resched-public/resched/</a></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unzip the downloaded Galion ReSched software in a suitable location.
Issue any necessary chmod commands to ensure that the web server user
can access the files and execute the cgi scripts.  For security
reasons, it is important to ensure that dbconfig.pl cannot be directly
accessed by web users.  (If .pl is associated with cgi execution,
chmod ugo-x dbconfig.pl should do this.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you have the prerequisite software installed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need an RDBMS.  At this time MySQL is the only one fully
supported, though it would probably only require minor changes (mostly
to <code>db.pl</code>) to support Postgres or any other reasonably capable DBMS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need a web server, of course.  I've only tested with Apache.  The
web server must be configured to serve out the directory where you
unzipped resched, and the .cgi extension must be associated with perl
(or may use shebangs if <code>/usr/bin/perl</code> is the correct path to perl on
your system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of which, you need perl, and at least the following modules
(available from the CPAN):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="datetime" class="item"><code>DateTime</code></a></strong>

</li>
<li><strong><a name="datetime_span" class="item"><code>DateTime::Span</code></a></strong>

</li>
<li><strong><a name="datetime_format_mysql" class="item"><code>DateTime::Format::MySQL</code></a></strong>

</li>
<li><strong><a name="dbi" class="item"><code>DBI</code></a></strong>

</li>
<li><strong><a name="dbd_mysql" class="item"><code>DBD::mysql</code></a></strong>

</li>
<li><strong><a name="carp" class="item"><code>Carp</code></a></strong>

</li>
<li><strong><a name="digest_md5" class="item"><code>Digest::MD5</code></a></strong>

</li>
<li><strong><a name="html_entities" class="item"><code>HTML::Entities</code></a></strong>

</li>
<li><strong><a name="taint_util" class="item"><code>Taint::Util</code></a></strong>

</li>
<li><strong><a name="data_dumper" class="item"><code>Data::Dumper</code></a></strong>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open <code>ajax.js</code> in a text editor and change the basedir variable (on
the second line) so that it contains the public URI of the resched
directory on your installation.  This value should end with a
directory separator (forward slash).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open <code>dbconfig.pl</code> in a text editor and assign suitable values to the
four variables therein.  (If <code>dbconfig.pl</code> does not exist, start with
a copy of <code>dbconfig.pl.sample</code>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into the RDBMS as a privileged user (e.g., root), create the
database you specified in <code>dbconfig.pl</code>, and grant all privileges on
that database to the user you specified in dbconfig.pl.  The SQL to do
this will probably look something like the following:</p>
<p><code>CREATE DATABASE resched;</code></p>
<p><code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON resched.* TO username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'somepassword';</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have not already done so, check that the MySQL root user
account is password protected.  (In most distributions this should be
the case by default, but check.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the <code>create-tables.pl</code> Perl script.  This will create the empty
database tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are upgrading from a previous version, check <code>CHANGES.txt</code> to
see if there are fields you need to add to existing tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create at least one user record in the users table, which you and your
users will use to log into the web interface.  You can use the
<code>create-user.pl</code> script to do this.  (Even if you are doing
authentication by IP address, you still need a user account.  The IP
authentication automatically logs users in based on their network
address, but it still needs a user account to log them into.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to do authentication by IP address, create the appropriate
record(s) in the <code>auth_by_ip table</code>.  Each IP address should be in
the same notation the web server gives it to you in
<code>$ENV{REMOTE_ADDR}</code>.  For Apache, this is standard dotted quad
notation (for IPv4; not sure about IPv6).  The <code>user</code> field needs an
<code>id</code> from the <code>users</code> table.</p>
<p>Authentication by IP address is probably not real secure, but my users
would never put up with needing Yet Another Password for this.  If
your users are willing to remember individual usernames and passwords,
that's probably better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create at least one schedule.  You can log into the web interface and
use admin.cgi to do this.  Multiple resources (e.g., rooms, computers)
can be booked according to the same schedule, so you may only need one
schedule record, depending on your needs.  The schedule record tells
what time of day you start booking and describes the positions and
lengths of the booking timeslots (e.g., every hour on the hour
starting at 9am).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each resource you want to take bookings for, create a record
in the <code>resched_resources</code> table.  You can log into the web
interface and use <code>admin.cgi</code> to do this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need certain entries in the <code>misc_variables</code> table.  You can use
<code>config.cgi</code> to create these.  Even if you wish to accept the defaults,
you should hit the save button at least once, so that the variables
are created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create <code>sitecode.pl</code>.  There's a <code>sitecode.pl.sample</code> that you can
copy.  If you need to do any site-specific name normalization, edit
the normalisebookedfor function here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may need to make a few changes to the code itself, as some things
may still be hardcoded that shouldn't be.  As time goes on I am
getting more and more of that stuff moved into <code>config.cgi</code> and/or
<code>sitecode.pl</code>, but this is an ongoing process.  <code>TODO.txt</code> might
provide some clues as to what remains, but it is not entirely
comprehensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonetheless, you should be able to start your local installation at
this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have questions or comments, you can contact the author
at the email address given in <code>INSTALL.txt</code>.  (I'm not putting
the email address in the POD, because the POD will end up as
HTML that will certainly be scraped by the spambots.)</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>
<p>When I originally wrote ReSched, we had three computers that we booked
in one-hour timeslots, and we wanted to move from a clipboard-based
system to something that we could easily access from any staff
computer.</p>
<p>I was pretty new to Perl at the time, so the early versions were some
pretty messy code.  (I've since cleaned up a lot of it, and further
cleanup is planned.)</p>
<p>I didn't really start tracking changes until version 0.4.0,
when the code was finally stable enough to go several months between
updates.</p>
<p>Enhancements in the 0.4.x series included aliases and the &quot;Did You
Mean&quot; feature.  0.5.x enhanced aliases and improved name normalisation
and overhauled the visual style.  The 0.6.x series focused on
refactoring the codebase and fixing bugs, but there were also some
enhancements, including automatic retrieval of new bookings.</p>
<p>After a conversation on the OPLIN tech mailing list, it became
apparent that some other libraries might be interested in using
this tool.  This lead to the first public release, version 0.6.7.</p>
<p>The public release lead to creation of the configuration interface and
a number of technical improvements (including the beginnings of MSIE
support, password hashing, and configurability or automatic generation
for many things that were originally hardcoded) in the 0.7.x series.
The &quot;Combine Rooms&quot; feature was also added.</p>
<p>The 0.8.x series introduced the program signup facility, improved
security in a number of ways, made several things more configurable,
introduced an administrative interface for creating (booking) schedule
and resource records, and continued cleaning up the codebase for
improved maintainability.</p>
<p>The 0.9.x series added the word &quot;Galion&quot; to the name of the software
(in order to make it easier to find by searching), introduced the
staff scheduling feature, made further enhancements to security,
enhanced the admin interface, fixed a number of bugs, and added
POD documentation.</p>
