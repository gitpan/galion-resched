These are the steps I follow to do a public release:

 1. Test and make sure everything is working.
 2. Make sure CHANGES.txt is up to date, and note the
    release date.
 3. Make sure the version number and date (in include.pl) are updated.
 4. Update the POD as necessary.
    pod2text -q none Galion-ReSched.POD > Galion-ReSched.txt
    pod2html --title=App::GalionReSched Galion-ReSched.POD > Galion-ReSched.html
 5. Copy everything to resched-public/resched/
 6. cd to that directory
 7. In ajax.js, fix the basedir variable
 8. rm dbconfig.pl sitecode.pl do-release.pl *galion* *~
 9. cp sitecode.pl.sample sitecode.pl
19. cd ..
11. Create a version-number-named symlink to resched
12. zip up the contents of the version-number-named
    (symlink) directory into a zipfile also named
    with the version number.
13. cp /home/nathan/dbconfig-public.pl resched/dbconfig.pl
    (This is the version that makes the demo work.)
14. Update index.html to include the new version.
15. Upload the new version to the CPAN via PAUSE.
